                                    The Objective of the Business Impact Analysis (BIA) ois the identification and analysis of business processes/activities (including required resources), with the objective of understanding the
                                    impact of downtime, which drives the assignment of the recovery objectives and prioritization.

                                <p>
                                    Following the BIA, the organization should be positioned to identify the critical activities that contribute to the delivery of its most important products and services, list all resources needed
                                    for recovery, and prioritize activities and resources by recovery objective.
